4. For each video:
  - Create a header containing your video's name using a **header** tag bigger than **h3**
  - Create a thumbnail for each video using an **image** tag and set the value of the class attribute to `thumbnail`.
  - Create a description for each video using either a **paragraph** tag that includes who it is by, when the video was posted, and how many views it recieved so far

## CSS
1. Set the background image of the body using the `element` selector.

2. Change the background color of the container using the `id` selector.

3. Change the styles of the individual videos using the `class` selector.
  - Using the **display** property, align the videos side by side
  - Set all video thumbnails to the same size.

4. Modify your elements with these style attributes:
  - `background-color`
  - `color`
  - `font-size`
  - `font-family`
  - `height`
  - `text-align`
  - `width`

## Stretch Goals:
  - Use a **video** tag to play the video when clicked.
  - Use a pseudo selector like *hover* to add animation when clicking or hovering over a video
